# STEP 1: Load Balancing
# Monitor the load on each shard and redistribute data to ensure that no single shard becomes a bottleneck

# Ensure that the system can continue to operate even if one or more shards fail

# Reduce the storage requirements for the data in the shards

# Protect the data in the shards from unauthorized access

# STEP 5: Query Optimization
# Ensure that queries can be executed as efficiently as possible
function optimize_query(query)
